Shadows offer an interface for AnnData and MuData files on disk that enables loading the necessary parts of the datasets into memory (and caching them) only when needed.

More features and details of (low!) memory consumption are outlined on the following pages:

- [key features and memory consumption tracking](shadow-objects.ipynb),

- [more features](shadows-features.ipynb),

- [zarr interface](shadows-zarr.ipynb).
